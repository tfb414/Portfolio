# BlockyBlocks

This is a pygame that was started within the first week of starting my DigitalCrafts bootcamp. It utilizes python and object oriented programming fundamentals.

### Installing

To run this pygame please make sure that python is installed locally on your computer. Clone or download the python file and navigate to the correct directory. Execute the file via command line by typing python blockyblocks.py to initialize it.

### Game Mechanics

This game in itâ€™s current form is a simple avoidance game. You as the main block are supposed to avoid the yellow blocks as they come across the screen.
